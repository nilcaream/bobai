# Bob AI

Bob AI is a browser-first coding agent focused on radical transparency for anyone who wants to inspect and understand their assistant’s full context. We are building it in the open so contributors who share the goal of a dependable everyday coding companion can shape it together.

## What makes Bob AI different
- **Radical context transparency:** Every session should show exactly what fits into the model context - system prompt footprint, tool transcripts, token usage, and anything trimmed for space.
- **Real-time context garbage collection:** Future iterations will treat compaction as a first-class problem, streaming telemetry about what stays, what gets evicted, and why.
- **Browser-native experience:** The agent should feel at home in the browser, offering immediate feedback without heavy local installs.

## How to contribute
- **Share ideas or issues** around context introspection, visualization, or compaction strategies.
- **Prototype browser UI pieces** that help users inspect session state and understand upcoming evictions.
- **Experiment with transparency tooling** - for example, token budgets, prompt heatmaps, or GC dashboards.

We welcome contributions - just respect the guiding principles above and avoid importing external code wholesale.
